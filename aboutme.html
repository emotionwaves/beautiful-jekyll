I am Roza Kamiloglu, a PhD candidate in psychology at University of Amsterdam where I developed my fascination for emotional vocalizations. 
<br>
<br>
I have been occupied by a puzzle since my undergraduate that is human ability to communicate emotions via sensory systems in social context. In my PhD project, under the supervision of <a href="http://www.uva.nl/profiel/s/a/d.a.sauter/d.a.sauter.html" style="color: #0085a1">Disa Sauter</a> and <a href="http://www.uva.nl/profiel/f/i/a.h.fischer/a.h.fischer.html" style="color: #0085a1">Agneta Fischer</a>, I am working on nonverbal vocal expressions associated with specific positive emotions across cultures and the lifespan. We will share related research output in this website. 
<br>
<br>
I am also a member of Amsterdam Interdiciplinary Center of Emotion. To find out more about our research, click <a href="http://aice.uva.nl" style="color: #0085a1">here</a>.
