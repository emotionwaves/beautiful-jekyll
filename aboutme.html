I am Roza Kamiloglu, a Phd candidate in psychology at University of Amsterdam where I developed my fascination for emotional vocalizations. 
<br>
I have been occupied by a puzzle since my undergraduate that is how emotions and sensory systems inteact in social context. I completed my B.A in Psychology and B.S in Physics with double major program at Ko√ß University, Turkey followed by a masters in Social Psychology from the same university (2016). Upon my graduation, I worked as a researcher at Utrecht University on olfactory modality as a medium of social communication. 
<br>
In my PhD project, under the supervision of Disa Sauter and Agneta Fischer, I am working on nonverbal vocal expressions associated with specific positive emotions across cultures and the lifespan. 
<br>
I will share my PhD research output in this website. I am also a member of Amsterdam Interdiciplinary Center of Emotion. To find out more about our research, you can click <a href="http://aice.uva.nl" style="color: #0085a1">here</a>.</li>
