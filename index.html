Vocal communication has been defined as the interaction between a producer (say a speaker), sending a signal (a word) 
to a receiver (a listener). Thus, in an exchange between two persons, a vocal signal conveys information with verbal 
or nonverbal content from producer to receiver. Information in vocal signals has been proposed to be a primary form 
through which we communicate our emotional state (Darwin, 1872). The voice caries cues about the emotional state of 
the producer addressed to the receiver. Since Darwinâ€™s early proposal, a large literature has established that the 
human voice alone is sufficient to communicate discrete emotional states. 
 

We investigate the acoustic cues reflecting specific positive emotional states.
