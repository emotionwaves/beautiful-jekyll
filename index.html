The human voice carries emotional information within its acoustic signal and these cues constitute a primary 
channel of communication. Vocal emotional cues are manifested in both verbal and nonverbal forms. In recent years, 
research on emotional communication is growing aware of finer differentiations between positive emotions and is 
increasingly examining a range of diverse positive emotions, such as elation, interest, relief, and pride. However, 
there is no systematic research on emotion specific patterns of acoustic parameters. 

We investigate the acoustic cues found to be reflecting specific positive emotional states.
