<br>
We investigate acoustic cues in the human voice reflecting specific positive emotional states. 
<br>
<br>
Vocal communication has been defined as the interaction between <b>a producer</b> (say a speaker), sending a signal (a word) to <b>a receiver</b> (a listener). Thus, in an exchange between two persons, a vocal signal conveys information with verbal or nonverbal content from producer to receiver. 
<br>
<br>
In our research, we sought to establish, where possible, patterns of vocal acoustic cues that are characteristic of <b>distinct positive emotions</b>. You will be able to access the findings of our research on nonverbal vocal expressions associated with specific positive emotions across <b>cultures</b> (Japan, Namibia, and Netherlands) and the <b>lifespan</b> (from the age of 4 years).
