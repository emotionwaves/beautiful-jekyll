The human voice carries emotional information within its acoustic signal and these cues constitute a primary 
channel of communication. Vocal emotional cues are manifested in both verbal and nonverbal forms. In recent years, 
research on emotional communication is growing aware of finer differentiations between positive emotions and is 
increasingly examining a range of diverse positive emotions, such as elation, interest, relief, and pride. However, 
there is to date no systematic review of emotion specific patterns of acoustic parameters, and an integration and 
synthesis of these findings is lacking. In this review, we comprehensively review research investigating acoustic profiles 
of specific positive emotions (n = ). We review the classifications of discrete positive emotions, emotional vocalization 
elicitation, and the acoustic cues found to be reflecting specific positive emotional states.
